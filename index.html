        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h1>Nurse Robot (Graduation Project with grade excellent)</h1> 
                We built a nurse robot to help doctors in hospitals to avoid them from Corona Virus and we built 
                a website and mobile application to control the robot We give it the number of room and name of 
                patient and it goes to detect the QR code on rooms and when it detect the right room, it goes 
                inside the right room and detect the patient by face recognition and gives him the medicine and 
                take from him temperature and blood pressure and send the results to mobile application.</li>
            <li><h1>Top 250 Movies in IMDB</h1>
                I scraped data from IMDB by using (python, beautiful soup) then I edited data by using power 
                query on excel and made visualization by using power BI and finally made ML model to predict 
                the No of Wins.
                </li>
            <li><h2>English to Malay Translator</h2>
                Goal of that app translation from language to another, I used transformer model to build it, built 
                decoder and encoder, English is encoder, and Malay is decoder made tokenizer by using BEP 
                tokenizer.</li>
            <li>
                <h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset: 
               </h1>
               Goal of project is detected the fraud and nonfraud dataset on credit card transaction, I made 
visualize by using matplotlib and seaborn, add normalization by using standard scaler, add new 
features to improve the model, test many classification algorithms to know the best algorithm, 
evaluated model by using confusion matrix, classification report and Roc curve.
            </li>  
            <li>
                <h1>Forecasting sales for 10 days (Time series data):
                </h1>
                Goal of model predict sales for 10 days starts from the day after the last day on dataset, I used 
XGBoosting because it gets relationship between inputs and target, I used suitable evaluate 
matric to evaluate the model and I made some Explore data analysis to get more insights
            </li>  
            <li>
                <h1>Electric Vehicle Population Data:
                </h1>  
                Goal of project analysis to get insights and build two model one to classify and the other for 
forecasting, I classified clean alternative fuel vehicle and I used logistics regression and made 
forecasting for vehicleâ€™s population by using SARIMAX
            </li>
        </ul>
